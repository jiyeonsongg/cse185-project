We are aiming to build **a peak calling tool by using Python script and their visualization methods**. We are planning to compare our tool to the findPeaks algorithm in Homer. 

We plan to use the peak calling algorithm findPeaks from Homer used in Lab 5 to benchmark the performance of our peak calling algorithm. We will run the datasets in lab5 on our Python script, and compare the results of both to distinguish the performance of our Python script in comparison to the established method for peak calling. Specifically we will be looking for what peaks are returned by our algorithm, and whether these peaks match those returned by findPeaks. We will also be using visualization tools like annotatePeaks.pl to create and compare plots of our peak data.

For the dataset that we chose, the researchers focused on mouse liver ChIP-seq and they provided the information of histone modification. They used two antibodies(H3K9me3 and H3K27ac) to perform the chIP-sequencing, along with a control where no antibody was used in order to examine the whole cell lysate. The mice models were in two different treatment setting, one is Regular chow diet (NC) and Methionine and choline deficient diet(MCD)
